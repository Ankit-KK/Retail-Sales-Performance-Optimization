   - Merging multiple data sources to create a cohesive dataset that includes store-specific details, such as competition proximity and promotional history.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns and peak sales periods.
   - Analyzing customer traffic to understand the relationship between customer counts and sales performance.
   - Assessing the impact of promotions and holidays on sales to determine the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

3. **Correlation and Causal Analysis**
   - Investigating the correlation between various factors, such as promotional activities, competition distance, and sales performance.
   - Utilizing statistical methods to identify causal relationships that influence sales outcomes.

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Developing predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data and identified trends.
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically using the Prophet model, to enhance prediction accuracy and support decision-making processes.

5. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Analyzing the impact of competitor proximity and store characteristics on sales performance.
   - Evaluating how different store types and assortments affect customer preferences and sales results.

6. **Actionable Insights and Recommendations**
   - Summarizing findings to provide actionable insights that can inform sales strategies and promotional planning.
   - Offering recommendations to optimize inventory management, promotional activities, and customer engagement based on data-driven evidence.
